# Frequently asked questions

## Why does cruiz exist?
cruiz was initially designed as a helper tool to ease the learning curve into the Conan CLI, as an alternative to managing custom shell scripts to invoke Conan. However, additional features were added, such as managing multiple local caches, opening multiple recipes, visualisation of dependency graphs, and the Artifactory remote browser that became very useful in my own day-to-day work.

## Why choose Python?
Two fold; it was easy to prototype but also integrated nicely with Conan itself, allowing cruiz access to Conan results directly in the interpreter, without needing to reinterpret CLI output.

## Why was v1.3.0 the first public release?
To bring to open source, the software was renamed to cruiz, but I decided to keep the existing versioning since it had been battle tested by myself and others I had shared it with.
